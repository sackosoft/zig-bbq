## About

`zig-bbq` implements the **B**lock-based **B**ounded **Q**ueue (BBQ) algorithm; a lock-free threadsafe ring buffer,
designed for high-performance data transfer between threads. BBQ is suitable for both lossless ("retry-new") and
lossy ("drop-old") producer-consumer scenarios, making it ideal for message passing, work distribution, profiling,
tracing, and debugging.


## Features

- ðŸ”“ **Lock-free** ring buffer for concurrent producer-consumer scenarios.
- ðŸ“„ **Configurable** block count and block size to enable performance tuning.
    - The paper describes a tradeoff between throughput and latency.
- ðŸ”€ **Two Modes** of operation:
    - `RetryNewQueue`: lossless, blocks producers when full.
    - `DropOldQueue`: lossy, overwrites oldest unconsumed data when full.
- âš¡ **High-performance** demonstrated across a range of benchmarks
    - "In **single-producer/single-consumer micro-benchmarks, BBQ yields 11.3x to 42.4x higher throughput** than
      the ringbuffers from Linux kernel, DPDK, Boost, and Folly libraries."
    - "In **real world scenarios, BBQ achieves up to 1.5x, 50.5x, and 11.1x performance improvements** in
       benchmarks of DPDK, Linux io_uring, and Disruptor, respectively."

## Zig Version

The `main` branch targets the latest stable Zig release (currently `0.14.1`).


## Installation

It is recommended that you install `zig-bbq` using `zig fetch`. This will add a `bbq` dependency to your `build.zig.zon` file.
The `zig-bbq` project has zero dependencies and is always statically linked. 

```bash
zig fetch --save=bbq git+https://github.com/sackosoft/zig-bbq
```

Next, in order for your code to import `zig-bbq`, you'll need to update your `build.zig` to do the following:

1. get a reference the `zig-bbq` dependency (installed via `zig fetch`),
2. get a reference to the `bbq` module within the dependency,
3. add the module as an import to your executable or library.

```zig
// (1) Get a reference to the `zig fetch`'ed dependency
const bbq_dep = b.dependency("bbq", .{
    .target = target,
    .optimize = optimize,
});

// (2) Get a reference to the language bindings module.
const bbq = bbq_dep.module("bbq");

// Set up your library or executable
const lib = // ...
const exe = // ...

// (3) Add the module as an import to your executable or library.
my_exe.root_module.addImport("bbq", bbq);
my_lib.root_module.addImport("bbq", bbq);
```

Now the code in your library or exectable can import and use the BBQ library.

```zig
const std = @import("std");
const bbq = @import("bbq");

pub fn main() !void {
    std.debug.print("{s}\n", .{@typeName(RetryNewQueue(u32))});
}

```


## Example Usage

`zig-bbq` is thread-safe and can be safely used by multiple producers and multiple consumers
concurrently. The entire API is only four functions: `.init()`, `.deinit()`, `.enqueue()` and `.dequeue()`.

```zig
const std = @import("std");
const bbq = @import("bbq");

pub fn main() !void {
    const options = bbq.BlockOptions{
        .block_number = 4,
        .block_size = 2,
    };

    var q = try bbq.RetryNewQueue(u32).init(std.heap.page_allocator, options);
    defer q.deinit();

    const expected: u32 = 42;
    try q.enqueue(expected);
    const actual = try q.dequeue();
    std.debug.assert(expected == actual);
}
```

|--------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `RetryNewQueue(T)`       | FIFO queue containing elements of type `T`, blocks producers when full       | 
| `DropOldQueue(T)`        | FIFO queue containing elements of type `T`, overwrites oldest data when full |
| `.init(allocator, opts)` | Initializes a new instance of the queue                                      |
| `.enqueue()`             | Used by producers to add data to the queue                                   |
| `.dequeue()`             | Used by consumers to remove the oldest item from the queue                   |

| `BlockOptions`           | Set block count and block size                                               |
